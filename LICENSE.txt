=== STATEMENT AGINST AI-ASSISTED CODING TOOLS ===

1. AI-assisted coding tools/AI code generators learn from unknown open source codes. This causes the user to directly or indirectly infringe on the license for that open source.
2. AI-assisted coding tools/AI code generators directly violate the license of open source code used to learn on its own
3. AI-assisted coding tools/AI code generators makes the final license unclear.
4. Privatization and paid-for AI-assisted coding tools/AI code generators are likely to pose a major threat to the open-source ecosystem.
5. The copyright on the output of the AI tools is unclear.
6. Humans make mistakes, and AI learns human-made code. Although it may be more sophisticated than humans in repetitive operations, AI-generated code is not perfect.
7. There is a problem that AI cannot judge right or wrong. Bias may exist in AI.
