### 💘 What I always try to focus on

1. Security : Most important thing is that if data exists and specific type of access permission is made for target(s), only that target(s) can access the data with the permission. **No security = Not worth at all**
2. Privacy : Secondary important thing is that data owner must have permission to create/read/update/delete the data at any time to the extent permitted by law of the country in which the data handler belongs.
3. Quality : Architecture, services in architecture, programming languages and frameworks used to develop services, documentations for both maintainers and consumers, tests, libraries, repository management, branch management, version management, CD/CI management, etc.. must have a certain level of quality.

### 💔 What I hate

- Wrappers, extensions, plugins, .. that have own bugs
- Data being abused
	- Privacy data being abused
- Access permission being abused
- AI being abused
- Crackers without own belief in justice
	- Those who only moves by contracts or money
	- Those who only moves by governments
	- Those who moves to torture the humanity
- Laws that fails to keep up with technological advances
- Governments, companies and individuals that are responsible for environmental issues but do not try to address them
- Unremovable basic apps
- All kind of technologies that is made to harm the humanity
